Problem Statement
Startups in the AYUSH sector face challenges with decentralized, slow, and opaque
registration processes. There is no unified digital platform to manage applications,
track status, or ensure smooth regulatory compliance. This lack of systematization
hampers the growth of AYUSH-based innovation and entrepreneurship.
